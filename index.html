			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am interested in understanding the complexity within the biological systems using computational tools. My prior work under Dr. Istvan Karsai at the East Tennessee State University was focused on understanding the emergence of complex coexistence dynamics within predator-prey population using agent-based modeling.

			<h1>Current Research</h1>
			<p>Studies have shown that microbes benefit their host by assisting in activities ranging from digestion of food to controlling immunity and development. Despite playing an important role in animal biology, the factors shaping the acquisition, assembly and maintenance of the host-associated microbial community is not well understood. My current work, under Dr. Kasie Raymann, aims to understand the ecological and evolutionary factors shaping the host-associated microbial community and resultant dynamics using honey bee as the model organism.</p>
