			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi :) I am a graduate student in the lab of Dr. Kasie Raymann at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I am interested in answering complex biological questions using both computational and molecular approaches. Currently, under Dr. Raymann, I am working with honey bee gut microbiome. Prior to this, I worked on emergence of coexistence dynamics within predator-prey populations under Dr. Istvan Karsai at the East Tennessee State University. I am an advocate of open-source science and I believe that the fusion of biology and the computational prowess can lead to scientific wonders. </p>

			<h1>Current Research</h1>
			<p>Bees are important pollinators and play an essential role in agricultural production worldwide. These bees harbor gut-microbial communities which contain a large repertoire of metabolic capabilities impacting both health and disease of the host. However, our knowledge of the microbial assembly and evolution is lacking. My current work thus aims to understand the factors shaping gut-microbial community composition and resulting structural and functional microbiome dynamics in the humble honeybees.</p>
