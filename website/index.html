			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi :) I am a graduate student in the lab of Dr. Kasie Raymann at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I am interested in leveraging computational and molecular methods to understand host-microbiome associations. I believe that the fusion of biology and the computational prowess can lead to scientific wonders. </p>

			<p> When free, I like experimenting with cooking and photography.</p>

			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>Bees are important pollinators and play an essential role in agricultural production worldwide. These bees harbor gut-microbial communities which contain large repertoire of metabolic capabilities impacting both health and disease of the host. However, our knowledge of the microbial assembly and evolution is lacking. My current work thus aims to understand the factors shaping gut-microbial community composition and resulting structural and functional dynamics in the humble honeybees. </p>
